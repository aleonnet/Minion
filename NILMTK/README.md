### v0.2 Released!

v0.2 is a complete re-write.  Please see
[the docs for details](http://nilmtk.github.io/nilmtk/master/index.html).
The old v0.1 code is still available in the v0.1 branch and the [old
docs are in v0.1.1](http://nilmtk.github.io/nilmtk/v0.1.1/index.html).


nilmtk: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring Toolkit
======

Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the process of estimating the energy consumed by individual
appliances given just a whole-house power meter
reading.  In other words, it produces an (estimated) itemised
energy bill from just a single, whole-house power meter.

NILM is sometimes called:

* "non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NALM or NIALM)"
* "[electriciy | energy | smart meter] disaggregation"

Below is an illustration<sup>1</sup> of what NILM, in general, can do.

Please note that the paper was submitted back in Jan 2014 and the code
has evolved *a lot* since then!  Please do not use the paper as a
guide to the current API.  Instead please use the [online docs](http://nilmtk.github.io/nilmtk/master/index.html).

##### Keeping up to date with NILMTK

Please sign up to the [NILMTK-Announce mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nilmtk-announce) to be kept up to speed on NILMTK.  It will be a fairly low-traffic mailing list.  We'll just announce new versions, new docs etc.

[NILMTK is also on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nilmtk).

##### Current state of the project

The project is in its early stages.

Please note that NILMTK is currently a research tool.  It is not yet
ready for use by end-users, although we certainly hope that NILMTK
will be capable of doing 'plug and play' disaggregation in the future.

Please see the docs for more info.

##### Installing on Ubuntu like Linux variants (debian based)

NB: The following procedure is for Ubuntu like Linux variants (debian based). Please adapt accordingly for your OS. We would welcome installation instructions for other OS as well.
We would recommend using [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/), which bundles togther most of the required packages.
After installing Anaconda, please do the following:

- Updating anaconda
```bash
conda update --yes conda
```

- Installing HDF5 libaries and python-dev
```bash
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev python-dev
```

- Installing git client
```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

- Installing pip and other dependencies which might be missing from Anaconda
```bash
conda install --yes pip numpy scipy six scikit-learn pandas numexpr pytables dateutil matplotlib networkx
```

- Installing [NILM Metadata](https://github.com/nilmtk/nilm_metadata).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nilmtk/nilm_metadata/
cd nilm_metadata
python setup.py develop
cd ..
```
-  Installing postgresql support (currently needed for WikiEnergy converter)
```bash
sudo apt-get build-dep python-psycopg2
```

- Misc. pip installs
```bash
pip install psycopg2 nose coveralls coverage
```

- Finally! Install nilmtk
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk.git
cd nilmtk
python setup.py develop
cd..
```

- Run tests
```bash
cd nilmtk
nosetests
```

##### Installing on Windows

- Install [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/), which bundles togther most of the required packages.

- Install [git](http://git-scm.com/download/win) client

- Installing pip and other dependencies which might be missing from Anaconda
```bash
$ conda install --yes pip numpy scipy six scikit-learn pandas numexpr pytables dateutil matplotlib networkx
```

- Installing [NILM Metadata](https://github.com/nilmtk/nilm_metadata) from git bash
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nilmtk/nilm_metadata/
$ cd nilm_metadata
$ python setup.py develop
$ cd ..
```

- Misc. pip installs
```bash
$ pip install nose pbs coveralls coverage
```

- Finally! Install nilmtk from git bash
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk.git
$ cd nilmtk
$ python setup.py develop
$ cd..
```

- Run tests
```bash
$ cd nilmtk
$ nosetests
```
